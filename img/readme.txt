Features importance of each model and stage are in the folders, folder are named as the used model's name.


Features importance of SVM was calculate by function permutation_importance() in sklearn.inspection. In stage 1 and 3 all feature importance value are 0, so there is no plot about SVM stage 1 and 3. (In SVM the prediction is not effect by features so much?)
